The game opened in front of approximately 40,000 people and ended in a 1414 tie . It was the first post-season bowl game for both teams . The 1924 game was the tenth edition of the Rose Bowl , which had first been played in 1902 . Following the inaugural game 's blowout score , football was replaced with chariot races until 1916 . The Rose Bowl stadium had been constructed in 1923 , making this edition the second game played in the arena .   The game 's organizers had previously selected a team from the East Coast and the West Coast , and asked the Washington Huskies to represent the West Coast . Washington requested that the Navy Midshipmen be their opponents , and Navy accepted . Washington selected Navy in favor of several teams from the east which had amassed better records . Both teams had suffered only a single loss during the season , but Washington had won eight games compared with Navy 's five , although Navy had also amassed two ties . Predictions gave Washington a slight advantage in the game due to the weight difference between the teams : the Washington players were on average 10 lb heavier than those of Navy .   The game kicked off in the afternoon ; heavy rain showers had fallen the day before , causing a slight delay . The first quarter was scoreless , but Navy scored a touchdown on the first play of the second quarter . Washington answered Navy with a 23-yard touchdown run on the next drive . Near the end of the second quarter , Navy scored a touchdown on a two-yard run , giving them a 147 halftime lead . The third quarter was a defensive stalemate as neither team scored . Navy fumbled the ball on their own ten-yard line late in the quarter . Four plays afterward , Washington tied the game on a 12-yard touchdown pass . Navy threw an interception at midfield , and Washington drove down to the Navy 20-yard line before attempting a game-winning field goal . The kick missed and the game ended shortly afterwards .   For his performance in the game , Navy quarterback Ira McKee was named the Most Valuable Player . Navy led in nearly every statistical aspect of the contest . Washington returned to the Rose Bowl at the end of the 1925 season , falling to the Alabama Crimson Tide 2019 . Navy did not participate in another bowl game until 1955 , when their squad , nicknamed the `` team named desire '' , upset the Ole Miss Rebels in the Sugar Bowl .

All executed were members of WiN , who during World War II took active part in anti-Nazi resistance .   The executed men were : Łukasz Ciepliński , Karol Chmiel , Adam Lazarowicz , Józef Rzepka , Józef Batory , Mieczysław Kawalec and Franciszek Błażej . All of the men were apprehended in late 1947 and early 1948 , and almost all came from the Rzeszów area . They were personally chosen to take part in anti-communist resistance by Ciepliński , commanding officer of the WiN 's 4th Headquarters , who chose them because of their moral fortitude and their unbroken spirits .   The interrogations conducted by Communist investigators that ensued were particularly brutal . All seven were tortured and severely beaten ; Cieplinski 's legs and hands were broken , and he had to be carried for meals in a blanket . A staged trial that took place on October 5 , 1950 , was led by a group of ruthless military prosecutors from the Warsaw Military District - Colonel Aleksander Warecki -LRB- real name Warenhaupt , who served as the presiding judge -RRB- , Major Zbigniew Furtak , Major Zbigniew Trylinski and Lt. Col. Jerzy Tramer , who served as the Public Prosecutor .   The accused were not given an opportunity to refute charges brought against them , despite the fact that on several occasions Ciepliński had stated that he was tortured and that his confessions were extracted with the use of torture . The Communist judges disregarded his testimony . The courtroom was filled with UB functionaries . With approval of the presiding chief judge Warecki , the prosecutors publicly mocked the accused . The newspaper articles which covered the case ran stories that the accused men were `` Traitors , spies and American servants -LSB- who -RSB- will be prosecuted '' .   The accused accepted their sentences with calmness , as they had anticipated the outcome of the trial to result in their deaths . With the court ruling of five consecutive death sentences , the first of the seven men to be executed was Łukasz Ciepliński . Colonel Warecki stated afterwards that all seven were collaborating with Nazi occupiers and had betrayed Poland . After the trial , the men were moved to the Mokotów Prison , where they spent the next 137 days awaiting their execution .   Appeals for clemency sent to then Communist Poland 's president Bolesław Bierut remained unanswered , and the condemned men prepared themselves for death . Realizing that his tormentors would dispose of his body , Ciepliński decided to swallow a small portrait of the Virgin Mary , which he had worn on his neck . During this time , the condemned men shared the same large cell with other 80 anti-Communist fighters , among them Zygmunt Szendzielarz . According to the surviving witnesses , the WiN members supported and helped each other , tending particularly to Ciepliński and Błażej , both of whom suffered the most during brutal interrogations .   In the letter to his wife Jadwiga smuggled out of the prison shortly before his death , Ciepliński wrote :   `` My time is near . When they will be leading me out of my cell to die , my last words to my friends will be : I am happy that I will be murdered as a Catholic for my faith , as a Pole for my country , and as a human being -LSB- I will die -RSB- for justice and truth -LSB- ... -RSB- My last farewell will be only to you . I believe that the Holy Mother will take my soul -LSB- ... -RSB- and I will continue to serve Her and report to her about the tragedy of the Polish Nation - murdered by one -LSB- nation -RSB- and abandoned by the others . ''   Shortly before the execution , which took place in the old boiler-room of the prison , Karol Chmiel tried to escape by running along the courtyard and screaming `` They are murdering us . '' He was captured on a pile of coal . Even though he had been promised that his letters would be mailed to his sons ; the promise was never kept .   All seven men were shot on March 1 , 1951 , at five - to ten-minute intervals . They were executed with a single shot to the back of the head , the standard Communist execution method and consistent with the executions at Katyn Forest . The executions began at approximately 8 p.m. , with Ciepliński being shot first , followed by Batory at 8:05 , Chmiel at 8:15 , Kawalec at 8:20 , Lazarowicz at 8:25 , Blazej at 8:35 , and Rzepka at 8:45 . Two of the executed men , that is Ciepliński and Rzepka , were previously awarded Poland 's highest military decoration for valor , the Cross of the Virtuti Militari . The firing squad consisted of a single man , the notorious Piotr Śmietański , nicknamed by the prisoners the `` Butcher of the Mokotow Prison . '' Piotr Smietanski is believed to have emigrated to Israel in 1968 .   The burial place of the seven WiN soldiers executed by the Communist regime remains unknown to this day . The 1950 court ruling rendered by the Communist court was overturned in 1992 by the Warsaw Military Court and the seven convicted and executed men were acquitted on all counts . In the 1992 court ruling it is stated that the executed WiN soldiers `` Fought and Died for Free , and Sovereign Poland . '' \",\n",

The Iowa Hawkeyes who won the Rose Bowl were crowned national champions by the Football Writers Association of America after the bowl games were played .   During the 20th century , the NCAA had no playoff for the major college football teams in the University Division , later known as Division I-A . The NCAA did recognize a national champion based upon the final results of `` wire service '' -LRB- AP and UPI -RRB- polls . The extent of that recognition came in the form of acknowledgment in the annual NCAA Football Guide of the `` unofficial '' national champions . The AP poll in 1958 consisted of the votes of as many as 203 sportswriters . Though not all writers voted in every poll , each would give their opinion of the twenty best teams . Under a point system of 20 points for first place , 19 for second , etc. , the `` overall '' ranking was determined . Although the rankings were based on the collective opinion of the representative sportswriters , the teams that remained `` unbeaten and untied '' were generally ranked higher than those that had not . A defeat , even against a strong opponent , tended to cause a team to drop in the rankings , and a team with two or more defeats was unlikely to remain in the Top 20 .
